## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arijit-017/ISTE-Contribution-React
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ISTE-Contribution-React
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the application locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

   The page will reload automatically if you make changes to the code.

2. **Build for production**:
   When you're ready to deploy the application for production, build an optimized version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `build` folder with the production build.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application on platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase. Below are the basic steps:

- **GitHub Pages**:
   - Install `gh-pages` as a dev dependency:

     ```
   - Add a `homepage` field to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/repo-name"
     ```
   - Deploy the app:
     ```bash
     npm run deploy
